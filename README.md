# practice-problems
This is going to solve two problems for me:
1) Learning GitHub
2) Practicing the most commonly asked interview questions and less commonly asked interview questions

So this repo contains the solutions that I have implemented myself for some of the common interview questions. Although I have learned and implemented them myself but often times I gather inspiration from the books I read and the numerous websites I read on the internet so these are not my own ideas always.
